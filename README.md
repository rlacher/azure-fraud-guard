Foundation for an end-to-end cloud-native fraud detection pipeline on Azure.

## Prerequisites

- Terraform v1.12 or later
- Azure CLI configured with access to your subscription
- SSH client installed (for key generation, VM provisioning and remote access)

## Getting Started

1. Generate an SSH key pair for VM setup and access:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.ssh
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/azure_vm_key -N ""
   ```

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the infra directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rlacher/azure-fraud-guard.git
   cd azure-fraud-guard/infra
   ```

3. Initialise Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. Provide required variables either in a `.tfvars` file or as environment variables:

    - `subscription_id` (Azure subscription ID)
    - `admin_username` (VM admin username)
    - `admin_password` (VM admin password)

5. Apply the Terraform configuration to provision resources:

    ```bash
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```
